# Face_detector_Deep_learing
A deep-learning–based face mask detection system built using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and CNN. The model classifies images into two categories:  With Mask  Without Mask  This project uses the popular Face-Mask-Detection dataset and trains a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch.
